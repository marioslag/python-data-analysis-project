ML basic algorithms
Project Description:

The project focuses on building familiarity with fundamental concepts and calculations in linear algebra and calculus, which are essential for understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms. The project consists of two parts: vector and matrix operations and derivative calculations.

In the first part, you will use the NumPy random package to create random matrices and vectors. Specifically, you will generate two random matrices, X and Y, and two random integer vectors, a and b. The goal is to perform various calculations using these matrices and vectors.

The specific tasks in the first part include:

1.Calculating the dot product of vectors a and b.
2.Computing the matrix-vector product Xa.
3.Performing matrix multiplication XY.
4.Calculating the Euclidean norm (l2-norm) of vector a.
To ensure consistent results, you will set the seed in the random number generator using the last 4 digits of your student ID. You will then manually perform the calculations step by step, showing all intermediate steps, and verify the results using NumPy.

In the second part of the project, you will delve into derivative calculations and optimization problems. This is crucial for many machine learning algorithms that involve solving optimization problems. The aim is to gain familiarity with computing derivatives of multivariable functions and finding analytical solutions to optimization problems.

The tasks in the second part include:

Computing derivatives of given multivariable functions.
Solving optimization problems analytically using derivative information.
By completing these tasks, you will develop a solid understanding of linear algebra operations, such as dot products and matrix multiplication, as well as fundamental concepts in calculus, such as derivatives and optimization. These skills are foundational for further studies in machine learning and will enable you to implement and understand a wide range of machine learning algorithms.
